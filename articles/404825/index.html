      First, you just forgot what hysteria was when they passed the law of forgetfulness, what was hysteria when they passed the law of bloggers.  Now, frankly, I do not see much excitement.  There is such a thing as “critical mass”, because of which you get the feeling.

      In my opinion, when they took the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585">law on bloggers</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">oblivion</a> , for some reason they clung more.  I'm talking about how journalists tortured me.  You see, everything is quite simply explained, there are no evil intentions.  Any citizen can do anything in his garden.  Embroider tic-tac-toe, for example.  Dig the beds.  Exactly until, until ... Here we were embroidering, we were fine, yes.  That is, no one interfered.  Even now, if we seriously think about it, the state is not at all interested in what is happening on the Internet until we come to the state.  In general, if we turn the story around, the state did not want to see us, when we called him on the <a href="http://russianinternetforum.ru/">RIF</a> , it did not want to come to us.  Not at all wanted.  Sit there quietly, but we began to make noise.  Who attacked e-commerce without declaring war?  Who!  Sorry, we.  Who, sorry, plowed the whole taxi market?  And then he innocently got up in the corner and said: you know, there are still all sorts of licensing stories, you can clear them too, we will also plow them, we will also own them.  The same interpretation also has the right to exist?  The state is a story about taking into account many, many interests.  Population, business.  In general, the country lives, breathes, taxes normally pay, and suddenly, without a declaration of war, people come.  Sorry, here you come to the Old Square, in a plaid shirt, T-shirt, sneakers.  By local standards - total indecency.  And you want to talk about something with us (do not forget to put smiles when deciphering you).  So you didn't even show respect.  Now, if we look at this side, the state did not come to us at all.  The more we get into the niche of the state, the more we go to where the regulator has always been.  There has always been a regulator.  Is always.

      There has always been regulatory in the media.  We came, said.  We - "no, that you, that you."  Free media, free ticket office.  You see, my position is more complicated.  You can take the same position of conditional Milonov, or take a position of conditional ... Who is responsible for Lurkmore?  Khomak, yes.  And imagine where the wind would not go, if you are in one direction, you are on the way, in the opposite direction, you are not noticed.  And in the middle of standing and marking the facts, how they happen ... You get out of here, and you get out of here.  If objectively, the state would not have known us for ages, to be honest, and would have lived happily and endlessly happy until we got into the economy.

      Well, that's your opinion, I'm telling you about my opinion.  The state was clearly visible when it reacted ... For example, for me, such a symbol was the growth of e-commerce.  When Odnoklassniki appeared, everyone learned how to use computers and started a sharp increase in all our different markets.  And when we intervened, and not just wanted to engage in distance selling, but claimed control ... The state was really surprised when we filled up the Post of Russia four years ago on the New Year.  It appreciated the scale.  Not the Internet itself, but the effect of the Internet.  It still does not feel it and does not see, we must pay tribute.  But we are trying in every way to manifest ourselves, we want to say in every way: we are here, the state.

      I did not leave, I answer.  I have a very good story, it is called the great white shark.  The great white shark is a little deaf and a little blind.  She is reflexive, she swims for herself, she is very big, by the way, it is quite difficult to finish her.  But while you are near you will not start meltishit.  When you flicker, she flashes and twitches.  If you do not flicker, she does not flicker and does not twitch.  Here is my point.  We have made every effort for the state to pay attention to us.  Another question is whether we could not pay attention.  Of course not.  Because inside something grows, its life appears.

      So that you understand, let's take the story of the appearance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DV2AqNYPhFhw">Sasha Spielberg in the Duma</a> .  So I look at the deputies, at Sasha Spielberg and I understand that the legislators are trying to talk with us, but the trouble is that we did not show them to you, someone else, we showed them Sasha Spielberg.  Themselves showed pay attention.  The deputies thought, well, well, let's agree with Sasha Spielberg.  Then they started laughing.  But the general situation is that we should clearly understand, our industry has come to talk with other industries, which, I apologize, do not catch up somewhere, they have no competencies, moreover, they do not want to receive them, they don’t need it .  Therefore, I think, as in any quarrel, the fault is mutual, if we perceive the regulatory framework as guilt.

      And the second part of the question is extremely simple.  We all love money.  And if you look where there is no controller, there is no money.  For example, imagine a certain abstract city, where everything is good with transport.  Cars drive, all is well.  But if you remove all the signs, remove all restrictions, you will not be able to drive at all.  There are stories when the regulator increases the passage of volumes.  And there is overregulation.  For example, North Korea, there is Cuba with a fairly specific control over the Internet.

      Iran, yes.  And answering the question of where we are, I would say that we are at the very beginning of this journey.  That is, we are in a stimulating mode.  Since I possess competencies not only in real life, but also in virtual one, I can say that compared with real life, it seems as though we blow dusty particles from us and say: Denis, are you doing well?  Oh, hell, peresalili chips.  Wait, wait, now we will ferry.  Formally, the story is as follows.  First, I am sure that this is our initiative, a very persevering initiative; our participation in the ordinary economy led to the state unfolding in us.  And the second part is that there is nothing wrong with the regulators in principle.

      It is necessary to draw a clear line between anonymity and privacy.  What is anonymity?  This is when a person sells drugs.  When he orders a kill.  When evading taxes.  And it can not be found.

      Wait, I'll negotiate.  Then there is such a thing as privacy.  That is, the right of a person to leave his life private - as long as he does not violate the right of another person.  Here you mentioned the channel "Nemygar".  Today there was news that Klimenko uses ICQ.  Also came out with such an intonational history ... Look, I have so many sins in my life that the last sin I would like to write myself in the column of sins is, well, well, this is the use of ICQ.  If I even come to court and say that “Nezygar” has offended me, the court will say: I have not insulted.  Sorry, let him remain who he is.  He did not slander me.

      Now imagine that “Nezagyar” is you, and you write that Klimenko steals money and stole 100 million rubles.  I say: colleagues, I do not mind, but I want, if the person wrote it, so that he would answer for it.  This is a media model.  In the media, you can write whatever you want, but when you come to court ... A journalist can hide his source endlessly, Telegram hides sources, but until the law is broken.  As soon as the law is violated, Telegram must disclose the sources.  I want to honestly see the man who accuses me of having stolen something.  And I want, if he does not prove, then let him sit down.  I just want to have a normal relationship in normal life.  Because when you say something, you have to answer for it.  This is the difference between anonymity and privacy.  Your right to write somewhere and keep in secret that you wrote it - this is called privacy.  But when you sell drugs - I’ve a little bit of a twist here, so that there is a strong argument - I come to Telegram and say that I need this person, who is now trying to sell drugs to my son - and you are obliged to give it away.  That's the whole argument.

      AND…?  Wait, let me continue.  I’ve already got the bureaucratic wisdom.  Let's talk about already accomplished events.  Over the past 6 years, our deputies have adopted a lot of laws regulating the Internet.  Suppose it was like ... Here at the spaniel the tail is immediately chopped off.  And we cut it in pieces.  This is a cruel analogy.  The trouble is that everything that the deputies are taking, it really is - piece by piece.  But this is not the spaniel.  Because when they take the law on bloggers, it suddenly becomes clear, and <a href="http://youtube.com/">youtube.com</a> is who?  Unclear.  And who will measure the numbers?  I am not justifying anyone now, not blaming anyone, this is very important.  But imagine that you have 450 people sitting in the Duma with a different life experience.  They have neither my experience nor your experience.  I’m really telling some officials now what site traffic is, where to watch how many have watched a particular video.  They have a fundamentally different experience.  And here they are trying to regulate something, what they see as a danger, while the chain of expertise is completely absent.

      Now imagine, just stand on their side: where do they ask for expertise about the Internet?  This is a serious question.  Without banter and jokes.  We have the trouble of the Internet that we went like a football.  Everyone understands football, everyone understands the Internet.  And as a result of what the deputies are taking, well, for example, the story of the blue whale.  I professionally understand that this is a bloated story, I professionally understand that we are dealing with a flashmob modification.  Deputies really adopt the law on strengthening responsibility.  Forgive me, but for 15 years really caught at least one?  And now pay attention, there are a lot of moments in this story.  This includes an explanation of why they want to block the VPN.  Have you talked to deputies?  Have you tried to offer them at least some mechanism how to deal with this?

      She goes on the same border.  I started talking about laws.  We always cut the tail to the wrong spaniel.  I am absolutely sure that all states will build virtual boundaries.  In varying degrees of transparency, in varying degrees of rigidity, depending on how the state relates to this.  There is a variant of North Korea, and in America, it must be admitted, it has its borders, only they are determined by the fact that they own all the resources that exist.  Both our state, and France, and Germany will sooner or later come to the conclusion that the work on their territory of foreign services will be regulated.  All build boundaries.  Please Ukraine, a typical example.  They put a fragmentary border.  There were 26 million Ukrainians a day visiting the Russian-language Internet, how much is left?

      8 million. Of these, 2.5 million go for VPN, and there is a tendency to decrease.  Now an experiment is taking place in Ukraine that gives all the answers to your questions.  Only at the expense of Ukraine, and not at the expense of us.  In all the laws that exist now, it is not legislative initiatives that irritate me, but the fact that orders are given that are not executed.  Neither the law on bloggers, nor the law on oblivion, nor the law on news aggregators in the sense in which they were initiated and discussed, are not enforced.  As a result, power is discredited.  Every time they tell me, Klimenko, you are a scoundrel, you stand on the side of ghouls, but I tell them: colleagues, who have done anything bad to you?  Who has regulated whom?  Where?

      ... Wait, wait, wait.  We understand what we are talking about.  Let's do the model.  Ukraine has always been a free, independent state.  The Internet was happy, always cited as an example, saying that you have a gadsky Roskomnadzor, and we have nothing.  No one felt regulated as you are now, and then one fine moment of khloby - and fell from the sky.  More and 1C banned.  I repeat: I am not ready to discuss core stories.  Deputies are deputies, the population is the population.

      The sword is brought.  In general, if we recall “Master and Margarita”, God forgive me, “we did not hang, we were not cut off”.  Human life is some kind of life itself.  Life is a resource - it is the same.  Nobody promised to feed on the way.  But for the time being ... yes, your electricity might go off, sorry.  Have you ever had a disaster when the resource fell?

      So what, how are you?  This sword ... Come this way, in a different way.  You know, you are now manifesting all the elements of a social being.  The facts are not terrible to you, although it was all.  You are afraid of what is, in principle, not happening to you.  In the sky thunder rumbles, you go out - and dear pray.  Here you are, by and large, portray yourself godly.

There is a law, act according to the law. There is a court decision, get it. We have about the same power as you. Forgive me if you are a saint, I drop all the charges, and say that I am guilty, but if by chance it turns out that you have sins, let me have them too. In the system, not in our private relations. Blaming a person whose job is to look for something is that he ... I have a lot of experience since the 90s, yes, and I have had different stories. I can not use the term "recruit", rather "Herman, but can we sometimes refer to you." Yes, I heard that too. What do they say that is unusual for their work? If you voluntarily agreed, what's the problem? Once again: this is not good,it is not great, but it is our life. What do your employees do? Do they give out information? You said "they called." Let's continue.</font></font>

They have such a job. Nobody planted you, nobody hid you, you don't commit anything illegal. I understand that this is an unpleasant story, nothing good in it. Unfortunately, life is not lined with roses. She is not lined with roses anywhere. But the question is how the authorities communicate.

Banned the domain, the scandal began, in 20 minutes the issue was resolved. Is it good or bad? Now the second question. Is it possible to repeat this story? Our goal is to train the system. If we have to teach a blind and deaf white shark, we must somehow react. Sorry, 20 minutes reaction time, what does not suit you? If you want to avoid errors, then first with your programmers decide that they are not mistaken. Once again: in the story with Roskomnadzor, we can laugh, but we can help. I do not in any way defend Roskomnadzor. But in their place I would turn to the industry and ask for help. Let's teach them. And laughter, by the way, is also a learning method.</font></font>

Just did not see the blast furnace and all. Is it bad or good? Does Yandex.Taxi have at least one who worked as a taxi driver? I am not defending now, I am just answering the question. I have seen many different career stories. Even in my example. I am now Advisor to the President of the Russian Federation on the development of the Internet, although I have a military education. In general, Roskomnadzor is an element of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media that was pulled out by us. In theory, everything that happens in Roskomnadzor, we must turn to the head of the department - Nikolai Anatolyevich Nikiforov. </font></font>
