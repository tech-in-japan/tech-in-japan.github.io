  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If you enter not in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Life is a game, sometimes we have to play by other people's rules imposed on us by circumstances and do not what we want and get used to, but what we need to do now.  Regardless of whether you like it or not.  Or maybe on the contrary, you want to try something new.  Or it’s just that the “stars came together” just so that you change the profile of work.  Be that as it may, sometimes it turns out that it brings you not to IT, but to some other sphere.  I dare to assume that in the vast majority of cases the work will still be connected with the computer in one form or another (it’s really hard for me to imagine a fairly high-paying job that you can come to without a specialized education and work experience from another field and not touch the computer at the same time).

      Why am I hooked on a computer?  Probably, because the computer is, first of all, one more problem: it turns on for a long time, it crashes, the file disappeared, the printer does not print, the scanner does not scan, it overheats, the screen is scratched, the buttons are knocked out, it’s just messed up at the very least so touch it it is nasty, not that work.  And the older the company, the older the computers in it, the more disgusting to sit down for them, the more problems with them. <a name="habracut"></a>  And it doesn’t matter that most of the problems can be solved without an administrator (for example, wiping a computer so that it becomes physically clean), it doesn’t matter that everything as one wrote “confident PC user” in the resume, everyone went through computer science at school and probably had at least 4 on it, do not care that they solve the problems with home computers somehow themselves.  In the office, all this fades before everyone firmly believes that another person should solve his computer problems.  Even if a person, excuse me for being blunt, a pig poured tea all around (why am I talking about this - I got a laptop after such a person, the mouse literally stuck to the table), it’s unlikely to wipe it, because surely someone should do it, not he (there is a cleaner - let him clean; an electrician came - well, so the computer is energized, let him rub it; there is a newcomer to the department - wipe the computer for me while I pass the clients here to you (you won’t make any transactions, but the computer will not be always clean)) .  In general, why am I?  Imagine that a person really can’t clean up his own dirt, but here the problem sits inside the computer, i.e.  conditionally, everything is much more complicated.

      And here you come to the company.  On the one hand, your position is not connected with IT; on the other hand, you know how to use a computer.  What to do?  I believe that first you will begin to configure your computer so that it works as you like.  Or maybe you want to “play a prank” something else, again in order to make it more comfortable for you personally to work.  But here lies the main snag: as soon as people see that you are versed in computers, they will probably begin to turn to you for help.  And then everything is quite simple: either you start to refuse them, or you can forget about a career in a new specialty, you will run and tune.  I confidently talk about this because I myself was in such a situation.  I set myself up, corrected my neighbor, made him the head of the department ... And then the whole company knew that I was “the very one” that I could do.  Yes, they didn’t pay me for this, but people almost always have an administrative resource that allows anyone to do any thing under the pretext that the company needs it.  Everything turns out so that as if I'm sitting, I’m doing nothing, and they have a very difficult problem, without which the sales got up, reporting does not give up, etc.

      It’s possible that I needed to immediately begin to refuse everything in a rude manner, and even better not to split up, but if you are a new employee, then going against the team in the first days and weeks is quite difficult, especially when you see that the question can really be "Difficult."  And then everyone gets used to it and all your statements are simply not accepted.  I became a hostage of the situation that I created myself: I want to work in a company, but not an IT specialist, but I can’t work in my specialty because  he (IT specialist) is not in the company.

      A few years ago I ended up in a company where my position was not related to IT in any way except that it meant using a computer.  Unfortunately, coming to this company, from the very beginning I made a huge number of mistakes, because of which the working conditions were (and still are) not what I would like to be in, but right now nothing can be fixed simply because that, firstly, everyone is used to what I know, and secondly, I’m not a fan of “undercover games,” which can’t be said about many of my colleagues who easily turn around any situation as if I could do , but I do not want.  Even if it’s not my responsibility.

      Some time ago I came across the articles “ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429034/">Several stories about clandestine programmers</a> ” from <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/mikhailian/" class="user_link">mikhailian</a> and “ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438038/">Career steroids.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438038/">Real Stories</a> ”from <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/nmivan/" class="user_link">nmivan</a> where I partially recognized myself.  In fact, doing my job well, I became an irreplaceable person in some issues, an expert.  Because of what, I began to be considered solely as a person who is uniquely able to close some of the important issues for the company.  I don’t want to say that I have a bad schedule, hard work or a low salary, I just understand that I could earn much more and bring more benefit to the company, constantly develop instead of solving the same problems and be in the same position all these years, but , alas and ah, initially I "slept".

      Concluding this article, I want to say that I don’t know if I did the right thing or the wrong thing (what if I would have been fired from another position?), I just urge you to weigh everything well, if you are not being put into IT and you want to help out of good intentions to your new colleagues. </div>
