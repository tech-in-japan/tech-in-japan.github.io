      To do this, you have to start a little from afar.  Nikolai and Pavel Durovs, at one time, from scratch created the largest social network VKontakte, which was, among other things, successful commercially.  In 2013, the company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">began to be</a> squeezed in favor of Mail.ru, and in the end it was successfully squeezed out in 2014, forcing Pavel to sell his stake, after which he became a fairly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/pavel-durov/">wealthy person</a> with a fortune in the region of three billion dollars.

      Just in case, I‚Äôll remind you how Vkontaktik looked like under Durov.  For many, it was a synonym for the Internet, it communicated on interests on various topics, watched porn and new movies, and listened to the music of favorite artists from it.  Of course, the team responded to the requests of the copyright holders, but did it somehow sluggishly, without much enthusiasm, deleting one copy of the film, leaving the remaining fifty.  Vkontaktik was quite <i>free</i> .

      At the same time, in 2014, the development of the Telegram messenger began, which, oddly enough, again tried to become an alternative to the Internet.  In addition to the banal messenger, bots appeared in it and actively promoted, implementing almost any functionality, media files, music and videos that anyone could download and anyone could download, a service was added for <a href="https://telegra.ph/">anonymous publication of articles</a> .  Of course, terrorists and pedophiles immediately began to use the convenient and secure messaging service.  Of course, the team responded to requests from the authorities of various countries for the disclosure of user data, but as a rule refused, due to the lack of technical ability to do something.

      In 2017, many remember that there was a real crypto fever.  This year, cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, hit the forefront of newspapers and television channels.  Everyone began to be interested in this new phenomenon, many made a fortune, many lost all their invested money, the cryptocurrency bubble was blown away as unexpectedly as it appeared.  However, cryptocurrencies are not only and not so much about Xs and a constant increase in value.  Cryptocurrencies, or rather, blockchains, if properly prepared, have one very important feature.

      <b>Decentralization</b> .  This word means that there is no single point of failure, there is no single controlling body, nobody, by and large, is responsible for anything, but in the aggregate, the system works!  This is due to mathematical magic called cryptography.  Each user of the cryptographic platform (usually called a blockchain, although this is more related to the structure of storing and changing data, but in this case it does not matter) has its own private private key.  Using this private key, you can sign messages containing various orders, for example, on the transfer of coins.  The magic is that it is very easy to verify (using public keys) that the message was signed by the owner of the private key, but it is almost impossible to find out this private key by analyzing the signed message.

      Thus, anyone, anytime, can participate in the network simply by inventing a private key (this is just a very, very large number).  Everyone who owns a private key can automatically manage the network account corresponding to this key.  No one can take away these rights, block an account or remove it from the network.  There is a private key - there is access, there is no private key - there is no access, everything is extremely simple, clear and honest.

      In 2017, cryptocurrencies were talked about from each iron, how expensive they are and how fast they grow, but the industry was still very young and inexperienced.  Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitshares tried to be useful, but they did not succeed.  The main reason was the imperfection of technology and a small user base.  Many projects even moved away from the principles of decentralization (NEO, EOS), placing and controlling the network on their servers in order to provide users with a higher speed of work, but this did not help either.  To make services and applications on these platforms was either impossible, or inconvenient, or no one used them in the end.  Therefore, nobody really did them.  Apparently then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Durov">Nikolai Durov</a> , a brilliant (at least extremely experienced in creating network projects) mathematician and programmer decided to make his blockchain.  And now we can say - he succeeds.

      Another important point.  Telegram Open Network, as well as Telegram, is, in fact, a personal project of two guys from Leningrad and a dozen of their friends / employees.  This is not a corporation‚Äôs project, multi-headed and whirlwind, which is always interested only in profit (present or future).  The corporation is controlled by the board of directors, it is controlled by large shareholders.  No one controls the Durovs, they are boys themselves, they sit and code their programs in a garage in Dubai.  For what?  But it‚Äôs just interesting, there is enough money for food, it remains to try to conquer the world.

      Now let's take a look at this agreement with the understanding of what TON is and what kind of people are developing it.

      The contract is concluded between the user and Telegram FZ-LLC, a company that distributes the Telegram client on Google Play.  Of course, no one wants to be removed from there, so the contract is drawn up in the most restrained proposals.  If we discard the legal dregs, the message will remain: ‚Äúwe are not responsible for anything and do not violate anything‚Äù.  Let's go over the points of the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/wallet">original agreement</a> :

    <ol><li>  The service can be used by someone who has the right to use it (of course, what else could be written here?) </li><li>  We reserve the right to amend this agreement (standard clause, ‚Äújust in case‚Äù) </li><li>  You agree to use the service in accordance with the laws (quite right, Telegram is white and fluffy) </li><li><ol><li>  Using the service assumes that: ‚Äúwe do not collect any data and passphrases, and we won‚Äôt be able to recover them‚Äù (of course, how could it be otherwise?) </li><li>  Next is the moment that caused the maximum stink on the Internet: "we can disconnect and delete your account at any time."  This is a standard unsubscribing response to various pedoterrorists.  The joke is that this is not just an account, it is an account on the blockchain and the user has a private key in his hands (in the form of a passphrase).  Even assuming that Telegram blocks you, any other alternative client to Telegram Open Network will return access to your account.  After all, this is a blockchain who has a private key - that account controls it.  But Durov has no access to private keys (see the previous paragraph).  So it turns out that this point legally shows the willingness to meet the requirements of various kinds of regulators, but in fact it‚Äôs just a fiction.  It is impossible to block and disable anything in a decentralized blockchain. </li><li>  Another dumping item ‚Äúeverything happens on the TON blockchain, it may or may not work, take some commissions or not take, in any case, we are not responsible for anything.‚Äù  This is important and correct, because Durov attaches the broad, very broad masses to cryptotechnologies.  The masses must understand, or at least get used to the fact that now they themselves manage their money and data.  The reverse side of the coin is that no one can cancel, protect, change anything.  How the network is set up - the way it works, someone complaining that you sent the money to the wrong address, or that the commission is too high, will not work.  Decentralization, no one is responsible for anything.  And this is good. </li></ol></li><li>  Once again, to consolidate, "no one is responsible for anything and gives no guarantees."  The meaning is completely the same, the blockchain is not mine, I just posted it. </li><li>  Limitation of liability, another standard clause in such agreements, ‚Äúif something happens, we can give you ten dollars, no more.‚Äù </li><li>  Again, the withdrawal of responsibility from the creators of the wallet on any issues related to the use of the product. </li><li>  And again, in capital letters, that no one promises anything to anyone, eat what they give.  Because no one controls the free Internet, and if no one controls, then no one can promise anything. </li><li>  A funny point, which separately states that the user pays taxes, the company cannot and does not want to collect and provide data to the tax authorities.  All in the spirit of the agreement as a whole. </li><li>  Again, legal water, with the common sense that no one accuses anyone of anything, does not bother, and in general, questions will be decided by a London court, if it comes to it.  Standard item. </li></ol>

      Now look, what interpretation of this completely non-binding agreement with the general meaning ‚Äúwhoever wants to do what‚Äù appeared in <a href="https://t.me/breakingmash/14232">one popular telegram channel</a> , I can‚Äôt help but bring her pleasure.

I don‚Äôt know why and who needs this, but the fact is obvious - from yesterday a negative attitude towards the project has been formed among the broad masses inexperienced in the crypt.
