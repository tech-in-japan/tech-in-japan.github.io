  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Always present your work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have Sergei at work, he is the deputy director for general economic issues, or just a supply manager.  The lamp burned out - to him.  A chair broke - to him.  The door was torn off the hinges - Sergei will fix it.  Need a new outlet - it will help.  Not enough space - organizes construction.  And in general, thank him for the light and warmth in our office!  No, seriously, we all understand that it is his merit, he found people, monitored their work and conducts maintenance, so our office is always bright and warm.  He does not present his work in any way, because the fact that he can do all this for no one is a secret, he is a supply manager, and, therefore, knows how to do all this (otherwise he would not become a supply manager).  Logical, right?  On the other hand, no one does his work for him: the bulbs do not change, the locks are not repaired, the snow is not cleaned, and the air is not drained from the batteries.  Of course, over time, you can even teach a bear to ride a motorcycle, so that colleagues learned to tighten the drop-down bolts, adjust the batteries, the most advanced ones learned that if furniture breaks down he needs to be called, and when you need to buy something new, something old needs to be photographed so that I bought it for sure.  His work seems complicated to people (or people just don‚Äôt want to do it themselves, even if it‚Äôs faster) and nobody gets into it, doesn‚Äôt claim its laurels.

      And, you see, our computers are a completely different matter, right?  Why exactly ours?  Personally, I will never believe that a good "near-computer" specialist will not be able to organize and configure something for himself.  Yes, it‚Äôs probably not as good as a specialist, but to put in a simple program, run the ‚Äúcycliner‚Äù, update the browser, etc.  everyone can, at least when no one is around, but you must do it.  The designer will deliver the graphic program, the accountant will update 1C, etc.  Within the limits of what is necessary for work, but will do it.  So people get the idea that if they can do this as a whole and no one complains, then they do it well, and if a person speaks in an affirmative way and even calls himself a specialist, then he knows how to .  And if the topic of conversation is clear to the interlocutor as a whole, then the person is definitely an expert.

      I will give an example now, unpleasant, but the idea will be clear.  For a long time did not go to the dentist to fill the canals?  :-) Yes, I understand that it‚Äôs really unpleasant (and from the prices it can become so bad at all), but the essence of what the doctor will do you know, right?  And when he speaks it, remember in detail all the past times.  And for you and for the dentist it is clear what exactly he is going to do, for sure he even has a diploma (or maybe not one), but every time before doing something with your teeth he will tell what he is going to do, to what it will lead to and how much it will cost.  Even if you need to remove the dental stone or just brush your teeth ‚Äúprofessionally‚Äù.  He presents his work, i.e.  tells you why it happened, what he will do in order to fix it, what it will lead to, what to do with it later and how much it will cost.  Now imagine for a moment that you came to the dentist with a bad tooth, and he tells you nothing at all.  I drilled something, got sick, then it stopped hurting and the doctor was so joyful, ‚Äúfive thousand from you!‚Äù (Maybe 25, how much does it cost you on average?).  And he did not touch the tooth at all with the one you complained about.  On the one hand, it doesn‚Äôt hurt, but on the other hand, something is expensive, and what he did there is incomprehensible.  Maybe the tooth itself went through?

      Previously, I always immediately solved the problem that came to me, constantly heard not very pleasant things about myself, did not understand why my work was not appreciated, and then completely removed from the position for which I felt very good.  They put a man in my place, but a man does not understand anything in this matter!  Damn, but how something presents itself.  The obvious (for me) thing is presented as a feat for which you need to give a medal and at the same time what is difficult (but necessary) is not done in principle, because  no one else asks about this.  People walk, suffer, complain to me that it used to be better (when I was, they complained about me, when they replaced me they started complaining to me) and all that.  And then several people gave me advice: and present yourself.  And I tried to present myself and my work.  And I liked it!  It really works!

      Firstly, the attitude of people towards me is changing.  People understand that I do things at random, but understand the issue, and somewhere after the next explanation, users even remember why this problem has arisen again and don‚Äôt do it anymore.

      Secondly, constantly presenting the work, I show my colleagues and management that I really understand the issue, and do not give out someone else's work or set of circumstances as my merit.

      Thirdly, what is obvious to me is, for many, a generally dark forest in which all the myths that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not difficult‚Äù are lost.  And those who want to do it themselves can always try to do it.

      Fourthly, each time saying what a person wants from me and what I will do for this, I get the opportunity to draw additional information from a person, sometimes it turns out that initially he needed something else, he simply explained something wrong.

      I will not draw conclusions, each of them will have their own.  Personally, even six months or a year ago, reading all of the above would not be disgusting, but disgusting in general (slander, fawning, bureaucracy and all that).  Read, not write yourself.  I went through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally came to acceptance.  I didn‚Äôt work better or worse, I didn‚Äôt sacrifice some principles, I‚Äôm not ashamed of the work and its quality, I didn‚Äôt lick, I'm sorry for being blunt, I just started to work in the way that people around me would understand.  I myself am the same person, and the people around me are the same.  But we all felt easier and more comfortable. </div>
